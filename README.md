This should be the most easy way to get a setup of the SYMPHONY library for solving MIP.

## install docker

```
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo docker pull ubuntu
```

## install

just type

```
./build.sh
```

to build the docker container. And 

```
./run.sh
```

to run the docker file.
A direct access to the interactive interpreter can be used inside the docker file using

```
/var/symphony/bin/symphony
```
